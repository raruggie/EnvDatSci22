A spatial lag model is a type of autocovariate model that assumes that dependencies exist directly among the levels of the dependent variable, and models them as an \"autocovariate\". So we create an autocovariate function that describes the degree to which the percent change in democratic vote at one location is affected by the percent change in democratic vote at the nearby locations. The coefficient and p-value for the autocovariate function are interpreted as for the independent variables."
